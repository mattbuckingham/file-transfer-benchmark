Cute little script for testing file transfers over a network.

I used this to see what the minimum expectations I should have for bulk file transfers in a production environment, I figure if it takes this long over my poor quality home network there isn't really a reason it should be any slower in prod, right?

You'll need to mout your desired network location and add it to NAS_TARGET_DIR.
